# Script Template

This is an arma 3 mission script template for HKERC

There is no `mission.sqm` for script. Make your own mission.sqm before using the script.

The template will build on top of minimal. That means all the template should have the minimal funciton. Remove those funciton manually if you don't need it.

Remeber to config the `description.ext` to fit your mission 

## Minimal Template

Minimum function and script. Just make it work. This include the respawn with last death loadout function and delete the corspe from disconnect player.
